# Searching

Searching is very important for any computer program. On a daily basis, we use the option of search so many times. For example, we use search to search through WhatsApp messages, or we use search to search through many lines of a webpage.

On the backend also, web browsers use search to filter through billions of web pages on the basis of a small string that we input.

In all of the above mentioned cases, the search happens in mere seconds. It is very important to search efficiently. This saves time, and is something we can not ignore.

This problem is not easy to solve, yet how are these platforms able to perform search so quickly and efficiently?

They use algorithms. A lot of thought has been put into crafting these algorithms which in today's world are used literally in each and every computer application.

In this folder, we study a few of these algorithms in detail. However, please note that there might be more better searching algorithms out there. There are just the ones which are important to solve DSA problems and which I know.

In the file Searching, we discuss about all the important concepts we will study here. Then, we have two folders namely, Concepts and Learning and Practice.

The Concepts and Learning folder contains all the problems which are important to better understand the concepts we will learn.

The Practice folder is the place where we dive deeper and practice more problems on these concepts.

Let's get started!
