/*
Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, 
then return floor(âˆšx).

Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
