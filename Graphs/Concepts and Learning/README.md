# Concepts and Learning

The purpose of this folder is to introduce some basic and important concepts of the Graphs. Some of the problems present in this folder will to build logic towards harder problem in the [Practice Problems](../Practice%20Problems) folder.

This folder contains the explanation and code implementation of some of the basic concepts in Graphs. Going through the contents of this folder, we will gain some basic understanding of the concepts and also get used to their code implementation.
