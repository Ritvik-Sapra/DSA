# Graphs

Graphs is a non linear data structure used everywhere in the computer science world. Unlike Trees, Graphs allow any number of nodes to be connected to any other nodes.

This is very useful. Our whole internet is built upon graphs with packets of data roaming across the globe jumping from one node to anthoer. The internet is nothing but one giant graph.

Here we are studying on some of the important concepts of Graphs and then do a ton of practice questions. It is one of the most important topics in many interviews as well as screening tests.

In this folder, we have a file called **Graphs.md**. This file is kind of like notes of all the important topics of Graphs in a very brief manner.

We have two folders also, "[Concepts and Learning](./Concepts%20and%20Learning)" and "[Practice Problems](./Practice%20Problems)".

The Concepts and Learning folder contains the content for building your logic and understanding about Graphs. This will help you in solving the problems.

The Practice Problems contains the content for solving problems across different sites. There is documentation explaining the problem and also how to solve it.

> The contents here are resources from Geeks for Geeks and Leetcode
